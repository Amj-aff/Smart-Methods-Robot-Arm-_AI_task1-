## Task Info
This documentation shows the steps of [Ros Noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation) and [Robot Arm Package](https://github.com/smart-methods/arduino_robot_arm_gripper) installation and configuration. The task includes many subtasks, which are installing Robot Operating System correctly. Then create a catkin workspace that you will use for download packages and libraries into it. After that, you can download the robot arm package and run simulators such as Rviz or Gazebo that will help to show how the arm interacts in the specific environment. In addition, you will almost face some errors, especially if you are using Ros Noetic version.
